- [ ] bulk convert my current underscore audios/subs2srs underscore files to use the actual file name with normal spaces
- [ ] button to open source folder
- [ ] read every sub folder in source folder, add folder it will ignore for easy management
- [ ] tag cards with the name of the source file
- [ ] allow editing end start times even without backtick filename
- [ ] add next and previous lines without a source file, for just text sentence cards
- [ ] PRE INDEXING
- [ ] make it so it only extracts subtitle files from every other video if its already searched every subtitle file in the directory
- [ ] add other audio to backside for pure audio cards
- [ ] store start and end offset every time its pushed, when user moves the whole line forward or backward it automatically adjusts the offset amount
- [ ] add/subtract 1db for each audio
- [ ] figure out a system to use language codes to always get the right audio track (box with order of priority?)


maybe
- [ ] implement 4 character sha code for file disambiguation, use few kilobytes from audio track for hash, add hash to subtitle files to link them to file, this will allow files with the same name to remain unchanged, allowing torrent seeding etc
